# OpenCppCoverage Binaries
This is a repo that contains the binary files for [OpenCppCoverage](https://github.com/OpenCppCoverage/OpenCppCoverage), which can then be used by github actions. For example [this](https://github.com/KungFuDonkey/Install-OpenCppCoverage) action uses this to install OpenCppCoverage to a Github Action runner.
